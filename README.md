# Circuit Simulator Development

The **Circuit Simulator** was initially developed using **C++**, leveraging its high performance and precision for modeling and analyzing electrical circuits. C++ enabled efficient handling of circuit equations and dynamic behavior through algorithms like nodal analysis.

Later, the simulator was reimplemented in **Java**, focusing on platform independence and enhanced user interface capabilities. Java's robust libraries and cross-platform nature allowed for easier distribution and integration of graphical features, making the simulator more accessible to a broader audience.

This evolution highlights the adaptability of the project to different programming languages, balancing performance with usability.
